<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This repository contains a series of exercises focused on defining functions and classes to manipulate and analyze lists, matrices, trees, and regular expressions. Each exercise is designed to be self-contained, allowing you to focus on specific topics at your own pace.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before you start working on these exercises, make sure you have a basic understanding of Python programming, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variables and data types</li>
<li>Control structures (if statements, loops)</li>
<li>Functions and classes</li>
<li>Basic data structures (lists, dictionaries)</li>
<li>Basic understanding of regular expressions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exercise List</h2>
<h3>Lists</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Intersection of Two Lists</strong>: Write functions to find common elements between two lists using nested loops and using the in</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate Negative Elements</strong>: Write functions to eliminate all negative elements from a list and to eliminate negative elements at positions that are multiples of 3.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Matrices</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Zero Matrix</strong>: Create a function to build an n&times;m matrix filled with zeros.</li>
<li><strong>Sum of Two Matrices</strong>: Implement a function to sum two matrices.</li>
<li><strong>Matrix Multiplication</strong>: Write a function to multiply two matrices.</li>
<li><strong>Transpose of a Matrix</strong>: Implement a function to compute the transpose of a matrix.</li>
<li><strong>Matrix Row and Column Check</strong>: Write functions to check if there exist two different rows or columns in a matrix whose sum gives the null vector.</li>
<li><strong>Column Sum Checker</strong>: Write a function to check if there exist one column from two matrices such that the sum of the values in each of the two columns is the same.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Trees</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Binary Tree Class</strong>: Define a class for binary trees and implement methods to print the tree, compute its height, convert it to a list (in-order traversal), and check if it is balanced.</li>
<li><strong>Tree Comparison</strong>: Write a function to compare two binary trees and check if all values in one tree appear at least twice in the other tree.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Regular Expressions</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pattern Recognition</strong>: Write a function to recognize if a string contains at least two of the words "legal", "Trump", or "policy".</li>
<li><strong>Substring Finder</strong>: Write a function to check if a string contains a substring that begins with "xx", contains "yy", ends with "zz", and has a length greater than a given value.</li>
</ol>
